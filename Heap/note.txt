We think of it as a tree, but stored in form of array in memory.
It can be implemented as priority Queue


It as a data_structure  can described as complete tree means all the levels are full except 
for lower levels

Binary heap has max two children for each node

Maxheap ---> largest key stored in the root node
Minheap ----> Smallest key stored in the root node

Finding the index ---> Parent Index * 2 + 1 = child index(left)
                       Parent Index * 2 + 1 = child index(right)

Heapify = after taking a node or deleting a node we need to re-arrange the whole node.
it can be up and down


Time complexcity = (insert and extract) log n 

algo
1.Create struct for heap
2.Create method1 -->Insert 
3.Create method2 -->extract
these methods(1,2) are accessible
4.Create methods are MaxHeapifyUp, MaxHeapifyDown, swap.
